# Fine-Tuning ViT, GPT-4, Whisper, and LLaMA Models

This repository provides scripts and resources for fine-tuning state-of-the-art models including **Vision Transformer (ViT)**, **GPT-4**, **Whisper**, and **LLaMA** on various tasks. The goal is to adapt pre-trained models to specialized datasets for improved performance in image classification, text generation, speech recognition, and more.

## Models Fine-Tuned

### 1. **Vision Transformer (ViT)**
- Fine-tuned for image classification and object detection tasks.
- Uses transfer learning and data augmentation for performance enhancement.

### 2. **GPT-4**
- Fine-tuned for text generation, summarization, translation, and question answering tasks.
- Utilizes domain-specific text data and prompt engineering.

### 3. **Whisper**
- Fine-tuned for automatic speech recognition (ASR), multilingual transcription, and speech-to-text applications.
- Trained with diverse audio datasets for better accuracy across languages and accents.

### 4. **LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)**
- Fine-tuned for NLP tasks such as text generation, language understanding, and semantic analysis.
- Supports multi-task learning and domain-specific adaptations.

## Features

- **Custom Fine-Tuning Pipelines**: Easily modify scripts for fine-tuning each model on your dataset.
- **Optimized Training**: Pre-configured settings for efficient model training and faster convergence.
- **Task Versatility**: Supports vision, NLP, and speech-to-text tasks with fine-tuning for specialized applications.
- **Pre-Trained Models**: Seamlessly integrate models from Hugging Face and other popular repositories.
- **Scalability**: Training pipelines support large datasets and multi-GPU setups.

## Technologies Used

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For accessing pre-trained models and fine-tuning.
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow**: Deep learning frameworks used for model training.
- **OpenAI GPT-4 API**: For leveraging GPT-4's capabilities.
- **Whisper**: For fine-tuning speech recognition tasks.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers
- OpenAI GPT-4 API (for GPT-4 integration)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jagdishdas/LLM_Finetuning.git
   ```
